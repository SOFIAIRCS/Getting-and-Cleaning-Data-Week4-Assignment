This repository contains the submission for the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

•	Download and unzip the data file into your R working directory

•	Download the R source code into your R working directory

•	Execute R source code to generate tidy data file

•	Use data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_avarages.txt") to read the data. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows. Note that the provided R script has no assumptions on numbers of records, only on locations of files.
